      <h1>The Effect of a Decade of Rising Opioid Prescriptions on America</h1>

      <p>America is facing what the president called an “opioid epidemic” with the rampant over-prescription of synthetic opiate drugs such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Codeine causing overdose deaths. Originally prescribed for pain management, these drugs are killing people at an alarming rate. </p>

      <p>At a record high in 2012, an average of 81 synthetic opioid prescriptions were dispensed per 100 people for pain across America. By 2016, the prescribing rate had decreased to 65 prescriptions per 100 people on average, however rural America and counties with smaller populations felt the impact of addiction and death much acutely. </p>

<p> Many small town pharmacies were flooded with pain pills and America’s over-prescription culture continued to evolve into what we now call the opioid epidemic. Prescriptions most often changed hands from relative or friend, or are prescribed by more than one physician to the same person. 

<p>Overdose deaths this year also rose to an all time high in America from abuse of synthetic opioids and newer more potent versions like Carfentanil, an elephant tranqulizer, and Fentanyl, a patch reserved for end of life cancer patients. </p>

<p>The prescription rate of synthetic opioids per 100 people in some rural counties across America was higher than the amount of people living in those counties at the prescription peak in 2012. 

<p>Pleasants County, West Virginia was one of the most highly prescribed places for painkillers in West Virginia. Synthetic opioid prescriptions increased over 80% from 2006 to 2012 in Pleasants County--which has a population of 7,674 people. </p>

 <p>This year in Pleasants County there are 11 pharmacies. Residents also have access to 13 more pharmacies in neighboring Marietta, Ohio. There are 20 pharmacies in nearby Parkersburg, West Virginia. </p>
